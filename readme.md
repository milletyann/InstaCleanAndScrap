This code is made to clean manually a particular dataset, on demande of my project supervisor.
This program performs type tests on several attributes of the dataset, including:
- int or float type tests
- alphanumeric (and "-" and "_") tests

This repo contains some functions to extract specialized features of the dataset.

Note that these functions have been written in a hurry and are sometimes not really clear, however 
it works and it made what I expected it to do.
